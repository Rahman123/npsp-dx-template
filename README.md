# Unofficial Salesforce DX project template for Salesforce.org Non Profit Success Pack (NPSP)

## About
This project allow you to pre-install Salesforce.org Non Profit Success Pack (NPSP) with Salesforce DX.
Unlike the official NPSP official install procedure, this project does not require CumulusCI.

The provided install script is built using Bash but it could be re-written for Windows Shell (PR welcome).

This project is a personal contribution, it is not supported by Salesforce.


## Installation
To create a new scratch org with the latest stable version of NPSP pre-installed, simply execute the `install-dev.sh` script.
Wait for all depencencies to be installed (a couple minutes) then, you are all set, no manual configuration required.

Note: dependencies are automatically fetched from GitHub.
